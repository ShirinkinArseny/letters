# Scrabble game

This project was created for the glory of global everything

Call `npm start` to run it on localhost


## Todo:

[ ] Serverside nodejs stuff to play online from multiple devices

## Wontfix:
[ ] Bonus fields that add score or multiply letter score. I strongly condemn this vicious practise, that results run-the-maze-to-achieve-x3-multiplier-game instead of building long sofisticated words
